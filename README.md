This was an assignment for the MAX Technical training full stack bootcamp. I had a bit of difficulty with this one, but I think for being such a beginner it turned out ok.
I only inclused the .csproj file in the gitignore because I don't think I have much of a frame of reference for what to generally put in there, but I guess that will come with time.
